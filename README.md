Keeping these windows open, over time, may consume system resources that will come back shortly after terminating the process.
The files take a bit to load, don't spam click them or there will be like 15 windows. 
CLICKING VIEW RAW ON THE PRANKWARE FILE WILL GIVE YOU A DOWNLOAD PROMPT.
Just use task manager to exit the Prankware. Troll your friends if you want. Don't execute unless you want it to activate. (Obviously)
